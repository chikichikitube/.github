Hello all,

Given the incredible amount of subtitling work being done recently, as well as the fact that Downtown are likely going to be performing until the heat death of the universe, I would like to quadruple the capacity of the archive for Chiki Chiki Tube with a massive 8TB SSD (from the current 2TB), this will hopefully futureproof things and make it easier to have more content.

What I want to do is match what I personally spend on getting the SSD with a fundraiser to donate to Mermaids, a UK charity supporting transgender, nonbinary and gender-diverse children, young people, and their families. As a non-binary person myself this is close to my heart and as you may all know, things have unfortunately been politicised by reactionary elements of society, causing a great amount of suffering for innocent people who just need help to figure out who they want to be.

The SSD will be obtained in a few months regardless and it will be glorious. But if you have the spare cash and would like to support the charity and Chiki Chiki Tube, please consider a donation to Mermaids!

Many thanks!
